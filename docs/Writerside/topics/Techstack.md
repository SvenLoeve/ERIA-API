VISEH consists of multiple frameworks. Let's start with the backend and frontend!
### Backend
The backend consists of an API and a database. We currently use Golang (also called Go) for the backend. This is a programming language developed by Google around 2009. We chose Go because of its efficiency and simplicity.

For the database, we opted for PostgreSQL due to its performance, platform independence, and extensibility.

### Frontend
The frontend is simpler compared to the backend. For the frontend, we chose Flutter, because it is cross-platform compatible, allowing us to release the same software on both iOS and Android.
